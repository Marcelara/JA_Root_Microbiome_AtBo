## Here we have .svg figures that need to be edited for publication

Analysis_flowchat: indicates the steps and tools used in the R script
deseq_family: differential abudance analysis showing taxonomy at family level
Exp_design_fig: figure shwing pots, treatments, plant species
fisher_fourpartiitons: the summarity heat tree for fisher tests, with one tree for each data partition
ordination_all_samples: base ordination with full community of all samples

## to do:
put all 4 network svg files  (Network_AT_root, BO_soil...) into a single 4-pannel figure 

###from MeJA-Pilot\R output\Neutral_models:
make pannel for Family diversity (Observed, Shannon and Simpson for AT and BO)
make pannel for Class diversity (Observed, Shannon and Simpson for AT and BO)
make pannel for Order diversity (Observed, Shannon and Simpson for AT and BO)
