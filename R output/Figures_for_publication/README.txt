## Here we have .svg figures that need to be edited for publication

Analysis_flowchat: indicates the steps and tools used in the R script
deseq_family: differential abudance analysis showing taxonomy at family level
Exp_design_fig: figure shwing pots, treatments, plant species
fisher_fourpartiitons: the summarity heat tree for fisher tests, with one tree for each data partition
ordination_all_samples: base ordination with full community of all samples
differential_heat_tree_AT.pdf: pdf file with matrix of heat trees for AT, including only above-expected ASVs
differential_heat_tree_BO.pdf: pdf file with matrix of heat trees for BO, including only above-expected ASVs
Rarefaction_curve: shows library size per sample (blaock lines for root samples, no action needed)
PCA_network_metrics: network metrics of the 4 networks, no alterations needed

## to do:
put all 4 network svg files  (Network_AT_root, BO_soil...) into a single 4-pannel figure 
put all 4 Ranfom forest svg files( RF_ASVs_BO_soil, RF_ASVs_BO_root...) into  a single 4-pannel figure [ACTION: ADD AN ASTERISK FOR COMAMONADACEAE ASVS; DATA ON TABLE SUP_ table_rf_taxonomies]

Put the following in a 6-pannel:
A) AT_soil_fullCommunity_NMDS + BO_soil_fullCommunity_NMDS
B) AT_neutral_models_plot + BO_neutral_models_plot
C) AT_above_NMDS + BO_above_NMDS



###from MeJA-Pilot\R output\Neutral_models:
make pannel for Family diversity (Observed, Shannon and Simpson for AT and BO) [ACTION: COLOR COMAMONADACEAE IN RED]
make pannel for Class diversity (Observed, Shannon and Simpson for AT and BO)
make pannel for Order diversity (Observed, Shannon and Simpson for AT and BO)
