# MeJA_Pilot

This repository holds the data and code for the pilot meja experiment where we test different methyl jasmonate concentration to stress plants, and compare microbial communities to a positive control with plant woundingn + caterpillar (P.pieris?) oral secretion

this project is in progress - formalization and finalization are still required
still, several scrits can already be of use for the brassicaceae family experiment
